Here is a collection of coding projects I have worked on over the years either during my education, small projects for work, or otherwise. 

# [DTL interpolation toolkit](https://github.com/neillinehan/NeilLinehanPortfolio/blob/main/dtl_data_interpolation_toolkit.ipynb):
At work, I often need to move data into a spreadsheet. This little collection of functions allows the user to input data from various years, often with gaps, returning it into a nice copyable form for inputting directly into a spreadsheet with years as columns. Its a tool to optimize a specific repetetive task. Also included is a simple polynominal regression using sklearn to fit the reported data, allowing the user to obtain a Google Sheets or Excel ready cell formula to calculate the missing years right in the cell.
